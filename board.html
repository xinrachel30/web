<h1>Jeopardy</h1>

<h2> Description </h2>
<p> In this project, we will create a Jeopardy game. The only difference between the real Jeopardy game and our game is that the questions will be given and the player has to guess the answer in one or two words. We want to create this game because Jeopardy is a fun and competitive game. It is very enjoyable to play and it tests your knowledge about concepts you have learned about in highschool! The topics of the game will include subjects we have learned from highschool and pop culture. 
	</p>
	
<h2>How To Play</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Open both the webpage and the Python program</li>
  <li>Select a tile by typing the following in the Thonny Shell:<ul>
  <li>The topic you want to choose, which is located on the top row, directly above your tile.</li>
  <li>The value you want to choose, which is located on the tile.
</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>The program will return the question. Respond using the Thonny shell in one or two words. 
</li>
</ol>
