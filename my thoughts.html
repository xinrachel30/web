<h1>My Thoughts</h1>
<p>I like shows better than movies because I haven't had many good experiences with movies. Movie theaters tend to be overpriced and your experience depends on the people around you. I don't go to theaters often, except for school field trips. Perhaps the problem is with the movies I've been watching, but they all seem rushed, especially with horror movies. Shows and movies are convenient in different ways because the cumulative time commitment of movies is shorter, but shows are split into episodes. Because of my time restraints, episodes are more convenient. I don't like shows because, the longer I'm committed, the less I remember about earlier events. I always feel like I'm missing something. That being said, I still like shows more because there is a lot more content and, if I like an active show, new episodes likely will get released soon. The time in between action sometimes helps me get to know the characters and process what's happening. If I like a movie, I have to hope other people do, too, and that they'll make a second. Then, I have to wait for it to be added to Netflix. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2013/oct/23/10-reasons-tv-better-movies">More Pros About Shows</a></p>
