  <h2>How Movies Are Better</h2>
  <p>Movies can be better than shows because they require less committment. Movies are typically an hour and a half long, so they can be a one and done deal. They're usually easier to watch because, for non series movies, there isn't a prerequisite needed to understanding anything. It might be harder to remember everything that is going on in a show. It's also typically easier to watch non series movies with other people because everyone's on the same page, especially if the show is based on a singular story. No one is ahead or behind anyone else. Some people that prefer movies also prefer the cinematic experience of watching something on the big screen in a theater. One con of TV shows is that some of them have excessive filler episodes as a result of their increased flexibility with time.</p>

  <h2>How Shows Are Better</h2>
  <p>Shows can be better than movies because there's more flexibility for what a show can be. A show can tell a singular story, or inform the audience about different topics using the same format. For shows about singular stories, there is more time to have character development and they can be easier to digest because they are split up into separate episodes. Shows can create a more long-term fandom and create long lasting communities for fans. Although there can be excessive filler episodes, when done right, fan service can be a good way to remove tension. A con with movies is that, if you did enjoy it, it would take a long time for the producers to develop another movie. For shows, there can be a consistent release of new content to keep fans engaged.</p>

  <h2>My Opinion</h2>
  <p>I like shows better than movies because I haven't had many good experiences with movies. Movie theaters tend to be overpriced and your experience depends on the people around you. Perhaps the problem is with the movies I've been watching, but they all seem rushed, especially the horror ones. I don't like shows because I tend to forget a lot of the information in earlier episodes and it's especially overwhelming when you try to talk to someone that is more dedicated to memorizing the plot. That being said, I still like shows more because there is a lot more content and, if I like a show, I can keep waiting for new episodes. If I like a movie, I have to hope other people do, too, and they'll make a second. Then, I have to wait for it to be added to Netflix.</p>
