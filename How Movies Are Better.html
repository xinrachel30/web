<h1>How Movies Are Better</h1>
<p>Movies can be better than shows because they require less committment. Movies are typically an hour and a half long, so they can be a one and done deal. They're usually easier to watch because, for non series movies, there isn't a prerequisite needed to understanding anything. It might be harder to remember everything that is going on in a show. It's also typically easier to watch non series movies with other people because everyone's on the same page, especially if the show is based on a singular story. No one is ahead or behind anyone else. Some people that prefer movies also prefer the cinematic experience of watching something on the big screen in a theater. One con of TV shows is that some of them have excessive filler episodes as a result of their increased flexibility with time.</p>
