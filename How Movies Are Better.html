<h1>How Movies Are Better</h1>
<p>Movies can be better than shows because they require less committment. Movies are typically an hour and a half long, so they can be a one and done deal. They're more convenient because, for non series movies, there isn't a prerequisite needed to understanding anything. It might be harder to remember everything that is going on in a show. Fans might need to rewatch multiple older episodes just to keep up with the lore. For similar reasons, it is also easier to watch movies with friends. More likely than not, people will be on different episodes of a show. Some people that prefer movies enjoy the cinematic experience of watching something on the big screen in a theater. One con of TV shows is that some of them have excessive filler episodes as a result of their increased flexibility with time. Factors like these can ruin a show at times. <a href="https://youhatemovies.com/blogs/movies-are-always-better-than-tv">More Pros of Movies</a></p>
