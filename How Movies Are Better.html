<h1>How Movies Are Better</h1>
<p>Movies can be better than shows because they require less committment. Movies are typically an hour and a half long, so they can be a one and done deal. They're easier to watch because, for non series movies, there isn't a prerequisite needed to understanding anything. It might be harder to remember everything that is going on in a show. Fans might need to rewatch multiple older episodes just to keep up with the lore. It's also typically easier to watch non series movies with other people because everyone's on the same page, especially if the show is based on a singular story. No one is ahead or behind anyone else. Some people that prefer movies also prefer the cinematic experience of watching something on the big screen in a theater. One con of TV shows is that some of them have excessive filler episodes as a result of their increased flexibility with time. <a href="https://youhatemovies.com/blogs/movies-are-always-better-than-tv">More Pros of Movies</a></p>
