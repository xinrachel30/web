<h1>My Thoughts</h1>
<p>I like shows better than movies because I haven't had many good experiences with movies. Movie theaters tend to be overpriced and your experience depends on the people around you. I don't go to theaters often, except for school field trips. Perhaps the problem is with the movies I've been watching, but they all seem rushed, especially with horror movies. I don't like some shows because I tend to forget a lot of the information in earlier episode. That being said, I still like shows more because there is a lot more content and, if I like an active show, new episodes likely will get released soon. I also appreciate that they usually don't try to rush the plot and the directors take their time. The time in between action sometimes helps me get to know the characters and process what's happening. If I like a movie, I have to hope other people do, too, and that they'll make a second. Then, I have to wait for it to be added to Netflix. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2013/oct/23/10-reasons-tv-better-movies">More Pros About Shows</a></p>
