<h1>My Thoughts</h1>
<p>I like shows better than movies because I haven't had many good experiences with movies. Movie theaters tend to be overpriced and your experience depends on the people around you. Perhaps the problem is with the movies I've been watching, but they all seem rushed, especially the horror ones. I don't like shows because I tend to forget a lot of the information in earlier episodes and it's especially overwhelming when you try to talk to someone that is more dedicated to memorizing the plot. That being said, I still like shows more because there is a lot more content and, if I like a show, I can keep waiting for new episodes. If I like a movie, I have to hope other people do, too, and they'll make a second. Then, I have to wait for it to be added to Netflix.</p>
