<h1>How Shows Are Better</h1>
<p>Shows can be better than movies because there's more flexibility for what a show can be. A show can tell a singular story, or inform the audience about different topics using the same format. For shows about singular stories, there is more time to have character development and they can be easier to digest because they are split up into separate episodes. Shows can create a more long-term fandom and create long lasting communities for fans. Although there can be excessive filler episodes, when done right, fan service can be a good way to remove tension. A con with movies is that, if you did enjoy it, it would take a long time for the producers to develop another movie. For shows, there can be a consistent release of new content to keep fans engaged.</p>
