<h1>How Shows Are Better</h1>
<p>Shows can be better than movies because there's more flexibility for what a show can be. A show can tell a singular story, or present multiple stories with the same concepts or main characters in the same format. For shows about singular stories, there is more time to have character development and they can be easier to digest because they are split up into separate episodes. The entire show can take a long time and dedication to binge-watch, but you can also watch one episode at a time. They are convenient in this way. Movies require a continuous average of an hour and a half. It depends on the show, but some episodes can be half that time. Shows can create more long-term fandoms and create long lasting communities for fans. Although there can be excessive filler episodes, when done right, fan service can be a good way to remove tension and interact with the fan base. A con with movies is that, if you did enjoy it, it would take a long time for the producers to develop another movie. For shows, there can be a consistent release of new content to keep fans engaged. <a href="https://screenrant.com/tv-better-than-movies-reasons-why/#:~:text=TV%20shows%20can%20be%20given,of%20familiarity%20for%20the%20audience.">Pros of TV</a></p>
