	<h3><li> Project Description</li> </h3>
	<p>In this project, we will create a Jeopardy game. The only difference between the real Jeopardy game and our game is that the questions will be given and the player has to guess the answer in one or two words. We want to create this game because Jeopardy is a fun and competitive game. It is very enjoyable to play and it tests your knowledge about concepts you have learned about in highschool! The topics of the game will include subjects we have learned from highschool and pop culture. 
 </p>	
      
	<h3><li> Instructions</li> </h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Open and run the Python program. </li>
		<li>Using the board below, type the desired topic and value into the Thonny shell.</li>
		<li>Type your response into the Thonny shell. Make sure that the first letter of every word is capitalized. Upon entering, the program will let you know if you were correct or not and your updated score. </li> 
		<li>Repeat until you are finished with the game. Once done, you will be able to see a line graph depicting your progress. </li>

	<h3><li> How it works</li></h3> 
	<p>Creating this game will require the use of python code through Thonny, a plain text file, and HTML/CSS. The plain text files will contain topics, values, questions, and answers. We will generate a dictionary of dictionaries using the plain text file in order to organize our data. We will also use a function to keep track of the amount of money gained or lost. At the end of the game, the program will generate a line graph on Thonny to depict the change in money over time. The website will be generated using HTML and CSS code. It will contain a brief description of the game, instructions on how to play, and a picture of the Jeopardy board. The Jeopardy board will contain topics on the top row and each tile will contain a specific value of money.
The actual game will be played through the Thonny shell. The player can pick what question they want to answer by using the Jeopardy board on the website as a guide. Based on the board, players can choose and type the desired topic and the value of the tile in the Thonny shell. After this, the program will print a question. The player will answer that question in one or two words in the shell. If the answer is correct, the player will be rewarded the value of the tile. If the answer is incorrect, the player will be deducted the value of the tile. The program will show the amount of money the player has after every turn by returning it in the Thonny shell. The questions and answers are all in a plain text file, organized by topic and value. The organize function will organize all of the values of the txt file into a dictionary of dictionaries. This makes it easier to refer to a particular tile. The score function takes the topic, value, and response. It will compare the response to the actual answer using the dictionary of dictionaries, topic, and value. If the response matches the answer, it will print a success message. Otherwise, it will print a failure message and the correct answer. The start_game function uses a while loop to continue the game until all of the questions are answered. The function ultimately produces a list  This list will be used to create a line graph so that the player can see their progress throughout the game.</p>

	  <li>Trivia.py: This is the game itself and it is run on Thonny. It is the python file where questions are printed and answers are submitted through the shell. </li>
	  <li>questions-1.txt: Plain text file will all of the questions and answers that will be used in the game. </li>

	<h3><li> Bugs, Errors and Things to be Aware of</li> </h3>
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    The topic, value, and response typed into the Thonny shell has to be the exact spelling, spacing, and capitalization. For all answers, the first letter of each word must be capitalized. If either the topic or value is mispelled, the entire game will start over.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Technically, you can repeat questions until you reach 30, the total number of existing questions.
	  </li>
		<li>
	    There is only one round of Jeopardy that can be played.
