	<h3><li> How it works</li></h3> 
	<p>The questions and answers are all in a txt file, organized by topic and value. The organize function will organize all of the values of the txt file into a dictionary of dictionaries. This makes it easier to refer to a particular tile. The score function takes the topic, value, and response. It will compare the response to the actual answer using the dictionary of dictionaries, topic, and value. If the response matches the answer, it will print a success message. Otherwise, it will print a failure message and the correct answer. The start_game function uses a while loop to continue the game until all of the questions are answered. The function ultimately produces a list  This list will be used to create a line graph so that the player can see their progress throughout the game.</p>

	<h3><li> Bugs, Errors and Things to be Aware of</li> </h3>
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    The topic, value, and response typed into the Thonny shell has to be the exact spelling and capitalization. If not, the entire game will start over.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Technically, you can repeat questions until you reach the 30, the total number of existing questions.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    The dictionary of dictionaries produced is ordered weirdly. The question and answer corresponding to the value 1000 come before the ones for the value 200. However, this doesn't interfere with gameplay.
