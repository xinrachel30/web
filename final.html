	<h3><li> Project Description</li> </h3>
	<p>In this project, we will create a Jeopardy game. The only difference between the real Jeopardy game and our game is that the questions will be given and the player has to guess the answer in one or two words. We want to create this game because Jeopardy is a fun and competitive game. It is very enjoyable to play and it tests your knowledge about concepts you have learned about in highschool! The topics of the game will include subjects we have learned from highschool and pop culture. 
 </p>	
      
	<h3><li> Instructions</li> </h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Open and run the Python program by clicking the small, green button on top. </li>
		<li>Using the Jeopardy board below, type the desired topic and value into the Thonny shell. Remember to type it exactly how it is seen on the board, with correct capitalization, punctuation, and spelling. </li>
		<li>Type your response into the Thonny shell. Make sure that the first letter of every word is capitalized. Upon entering, the program will let you know if you were correct or not and your updated score. </li> 
		<li>Repeat until you are finished with the game. Once done, you will be able to see a line graph depicting your progress. </li>

	<h3><li> How it works</li></h3> 
	<p>All of the questions and answers are contained in the questions-1.txt file. The organize function organizes this information into a dictionary of dictionaries that will help make it easier to identify individual tiles. The board containing the tiles available can be viewed on this website under 'Instructions'. When the program is run, the player can enter the topic and value according to the desired tile. The program will print the question. The player can respond in one to three words, all of which should have the first letter capitalized. If the player's response is correct, a success message will be printed and the player's score will increase by the tile's value. If the response is incorrect, the failure message will be printed and the player's score will be deducted by the tile's value. This is managed by the score function. The game will end after 30 turns and a line graph will be produced to show the player's progress over time. </p>     
	<h3><li> Files </li> </h3>
	<ul>
	  <li>final.html: This html file</li>
	  <li>Trivia.py: This is the game itself and it can be run on Thonny. It is a python file where questions can be printed and answers can be submitted through the shell. </li>
	  <li>questions-1.txt: Plain text file will containing all of the questions and answers. </li>

	<h3><li> Bugs, Errors and Things to be Aware of</li> </h3>
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    The topic, value, and response typed into the Thonny shell have to have the exact spelling, spacing, and capitalization as the ones in the questions-1.txt. For all answers, the first letter of each word must be capitalized. If the answer is a number value, write it in number form, do not write it in word form. If either the topic or value is mispelled, the entire game will start over.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Technically, you can repeat questions until you reach 30, the total number of existing questions.
	  </li>
	<li>
	    Only one round of Jeopardy can be played.
